# Hey, I'm Tim! ðŸ‘‹

### Iâ€™m a software developer with a focus on creating innovative and accessible apps. 

I'm currently trying out some desktop application frameworks like Tauri or the WinUI framework. I'm always happy to learn new things!
In my spare time I play basketball and try to do as many sports as possible.
