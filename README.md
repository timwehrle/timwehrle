# Hey, I'm Tim! ðŸ‘‹

### Iâ€™m a software developer with a focus on creating innovative and accessible apps. 

I am currently working as a student trainee in web development. However, in my spare time I try to learn as much as possible about other areas of programming. I am also interested in the security aspect of web applications and applications in general.
